# GnomeStronghold

# What is the Project
Gnome Stronghold is a top-down simulation game where your objective is to keep the Gnomes alive by fulfilling their needs and growing your Stronghold. You do this by gathering resources, assigning jobs, crafting items,  building structures, and fighting off enemies. The Gnomes are intelligent individuals who will try to take care of their needs and act on their desires. It is your job to assist them and help them form a self-sufficient Stronghold

# How to interact with it (controls, etc.)
Use WASD to move the camera, E and Q to zoom in and out, and ESC to pause.

Your objective is to keep the Gnomes alive and make sure their needs are met. Their needs can be found in Gnome Stats.

Click on the Gnomes and assign jobs using the menu at the top right. Their favorite job is highlighted in red.

Click on trees or stones to select them to be gathered, then assign a Gnome to gather them.

Assign a Gnome to work, and they will create items with stone, wood, fiber, leather, and metal. They can also create better food and drink as long as there are enough resources.

Click on build mode to create new structures. Select an area with the red box and choose the type of building you want.
